# Identifying Conditions of Hemlock Wolley Adelgid in Northeastern US

_Adlai Nelson_


## Introduction

Hemlock Wolley Adelgid (HWA, Adelges tsugae) is a host specific invasive species whose hosts include hemlock species. 
Eastern hemlock (Tsuga Canadensis) are particularly important to riparian ecosystems in the Northeast US. 
HWA has spread rapidly since itâ€™s introduction to the US in the 1950s, where it is known to cause mortality in Eastern Hemlock.

This research project aims to answer the following questions:

_What are the environmental and physical conditions that HWA thrives in?_

_What currently uninfested stands of Eastern hemlock are vulnerable to HWA?_

To answer these questions, I will use the case study of two states: Pennsylvania and New York
