# Identifying Conditions of Hemlock Woolly Adelgid in Northeastern US

_Adlai Nelson_

## Introduction

Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (HWA, _Adelges tsugae_) is a host specific invasive species whose hosts include hemlock species. 
Eastern hemlock (_Tsuga Canadensis_) are particularly important to riparian ecosystems in the Northeast US. 
HWA has spread rapidly since it’s introduction to the US in the 1950s, where it is known to cause mortality in Eastern Hemlock.

This research project aims to answer the following questions:

_What are the environmental and physical conditions that HWA thrives in?_

_What currently uninfested stands of Eastern hemlock are vulnerable to HWA?_

To answer these questions, I will use the case study of two states: Pennsylvania and New York

## Data

<img src="figures/studyarea.png" alt="map of NY and PA with Eastern Hemlock basal area dataset and HWA confirmed points" width="900"/>

The study area includes the states of Pennsylvania and New York. This is due to data availability.
imapinvasives.net partners with agencies in states to record observations, and these two states are two of the few states that have this partenership.

NY and PA roads were not representative of all roads, especially ones on smaller scales, however, I chose to use this dataset rather than state GIS management GIS datasets. 
Distance from roads is included as a proxy for ease of access, as sites closer to major roads likely have more exposure to people, who may spread HWA.

### Preprocessing


All spatial data preprocessing took place is QGIS 3.28.14.
All layers were reprojected to EPSG 5070, NAD 83 Conus Albers. 
All layers were clipped to the study area, including raster images.
The 

### Normalization

This project relies heavily on images, so the majority of the tables will be raster tables, and will not require normalization.
The vector layers that are included in this project
